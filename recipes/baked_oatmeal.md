# Baked Oatmeal

## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp flaxseed meal
- 5 Tbsp water
- 2/3 cup shredded coconut
- 2 cups rolled oats
- 2/3 cup slivered almonds  
- 3 Tbsp dried fruit
- 1 Tbsp coconut sugar  
- 1/4 tsp salt  
- 1/4 cup maple syrup  
- 1 3/4 cup non-dairy milk
- 1/4 cup coconut oil

## Instructions
1. **Preheat oven** to 175 C and grease a baking dish with coconut oil.
2. **Prepare flax eggs** in a medium-size mixing bowl by mixing flaxseed meal and water and let rest for 5 minutes.  
3. **Add shredded coconut** to a bare baking sheet and bake until just slightly golden brown – about 3-4 minutes. Watch carefully as it browns quickly. Set aside.  
4. **To a large mixing bowl,** add oats, almonds, half of the toasted coconut (reserve the rest for serving), dried fruit, coconut sugar, and salt. Stir to combine.  
5. **Add** maple syrup and non-dairy milk to the flax eggs and whisk thoroughly to combine. While whisking, pour in the coconut oil and whisk thoroughly to combine. Add wet to dry and mix.  
6. **Pour** oatmeal into prepared dish and bake for 37-40 minutes, or until slightly golden brown and firm in the middle. Then increase heat to 400 degrees F (204 C) and bake 5-8 minutes more to brown the edges and crisp the top.
