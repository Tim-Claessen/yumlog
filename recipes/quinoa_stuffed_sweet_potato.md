# Quinoa Stuffed Sweet Potato

## Ingredients

- 4 sweet potatoes
- 1 cup quinoa
- 2 cups vegetable broth
- 2 tbsps. olive oil
- 1 small onion, diced
- 2 cups kale, broken into 1 inch pieces
- 1/2 cup toasted slivered almonds
- 1/4 cup (plus) dried cranberries
- salt and pepper
- 2 tablespoons natural yoghurt
- dukka

## Instructions

1. **Bake** the sweet potatoes in a 350℉ oven for 40 minutes to 1 hour or until fork tender. Remove and let cool.
2. Meanwhile, **bring the vegetable broth to a light boil** and add the quinoa. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook covered for 10-15 minutes.
3. **Sauté** the onion in the olive oil with a pinch of salt until soft. Add in the kale, almonds, and cranberries and sauté until the kale is soft, about 3 minutes. Add the finished quinoa to the frying pan and mix together.
4. **Slice** each sweet potato in half lengthwise and scoop out the filling. You can either dice into cubes and add this to your quinoa mixture or save for a later recipe like soup or mashed potatoes.
5. **Fill** each potato shell with the quinoa filling and bake in a 350 degree oven for twenty minutes or until warm. Serve immediately.
6. **Serve** topped with drizzle of natural yoghurt and sprinkle of dukka.
