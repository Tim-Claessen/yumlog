# Recipe Name

## Ingredients

- 1-2 tbsp coconut oil or other neutral oil for frying  
- 2 onions chopped  
- 4 garlic cloves minced  
- 2 tsp ginger minced (or more to taste)  
- 1 tsp turmeric  
- 1 tsp coriander  
- 1 tsp cumin  
- 1 tsp paprika powder  
- 1 tsp garam masala or other curry powder to taste  
- 1 ⅔ cups (300 g) red lentils  
- 3 ¼ cups (780 ml) vegetable broth  
- 1 cup (240 ml) coconut milk  
- 1 cup (240 ml) chopped tomatoes, optional  
- salt and pepper to taste  
- 2 tsp coconut sugar or to taste  
- 2-3 tbsp lime or lemon juice or to taste

## Instructions

1. **Heat** the coconut oil in a skillet or saucepan. Add the chopped onions, and sauté for 2-3 minutes until translucent. Then add the garlic and ginger sauté for another minute until fragrant. Lastly, add the spices, and sauté for a few seconds to unfold flavours.
2. **Rinse** the lentils under cold running water. Then add them to the onion mixture in the skillet. Pour in the vegetable broth, stir to combine, and bring to a simmer. 
3. **Cook** covered for 8-10 minutes, or until the lentils have absorbed most of the liquid.
4. **Add** the coconut milk and strained tomatoes (if using) and simmer another 5-10 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. (If the sauce is too thick, add a little more broth or coconut milk, until the desired consistency is reached). Season with salt, pepper, coconut sugar, and lime juice to taste.
