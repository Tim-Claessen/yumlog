# Rendang Noodles

## Ingredients

- 200g mushrooms
- 1 red capsicum
- 150g green beans
- 35g rendang curry paste
- 200ml coconut milk
- 150g vermicelli noodles
- 40g roasted cashews
- coriander
- 5g toasted sesame seeds
- 1 tbs neutral oil
- 1 tsp white vinegar

## Instructions

1. **Boil** a medium saucepan of water for the noodles. Wipe the mushrooms clean then halve, quartering any large ones. Coarsely chop the capsicum. Trim the beans and halve on an angle.
2. **Heat** 1tbs oil in medium deep frypan over medium-high heat. Cook the mushrooms and capsicum, stirring occasionally for 5 mins or until starting to soften
3. **Reduce heat** to medium. Add the curry paste and cook, stirring for 1 min or until fragrant. Stir in the coconut milk and bring to a simmer (its important the curry doesn't boil or the coconut milk may separate). Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook covered, stirring occasionally for 5mins
4. **Add beans** to the curry and cook, covered, for a further 3-4mins until the beans are tender and the sauce is slightly thickened
5. **Cook the noodles** in the pan of boiling water for 7mind or until tender. Drain, then rinse under hot water to prevent the noodles from sticking.
6. **Coarsely chop** the cashews and coriander, discarding the coriander stems. Add the noodles and 1tsp white vinegar to the curry and toss to combine. Taste the sauce then season with salt and pepper. Divide the rendang noodles among bowls. Scatter with cashews , coriander and sesame seeds to serve.
