## Ingredients

- 250g raw cashew nuts
- 1/4 cup warm coconut milk
- 1/4 cup hot water
- 1 Tbs vegetable oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 3 cloves & 4 cardamoms crushed together
- 1 green chili sliced
- 1 stick cinnamon 
- 1 spring curry leaf 
- 18cm length rampe - cut in 2
- 3-4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 medium tomato, chopped
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 desert spoon Maldive fish
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 - 3/4 cup coconut milk
- 1 tsp lime juice  

## Instructions

1. **Soak the cashews** in the warm coconut milk and hot water for at least 30 minutes. Add a litter more hot water if necessary to cover the nuts.
2. **Heat the oil** in the plan. Add onions, cloves, cardamom pods, chilis, cinnamon, curry leaves and rampe. Cook until onions are soft. 
3. **Add in** garlic, tomato, turmeric, curry powder, Maldive fish and salt. 
4. **Add in** cashew nuts, including water. Stir. Check seasoning. 
5. **Turn down stove**, add more hot water if needed and simmer until nuts are soft but not mushy. 
6. **Add in coconut milk**, stirring gently with the handle of a wooden spoon so as not to break up the nuts. Bring to the boil.
7. **Turn off the heat** - when the bubbling stops, add the lime juice. Gently shake the pan to distribute the lime juice.
