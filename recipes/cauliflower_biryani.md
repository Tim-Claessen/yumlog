# Cauliflower Biryani

## Ingredients

- olive oil
- 1 large cauliflower
- 1 carrot
- ½ brown onion
- 1 clove garlic
- 2 tbsp garam masala 
- 2 tbsp curry powder 
- 1 pinch ground ginger
- 1 tablespoon bengal curry paste
- 1½ cups basmati rice
- 20g currants
- 1½ cups warm water
- 20g vegetable stock pot
- coriander
- 20g roasted almonds
- ½ long red chilli
- 2 tablespoons natural/Greek yoghurt

## Instructions

1. **Get prepped**. Preheat the oven to 220ºC/200ºC fan-forced. Chop the cauliflower into small florets. Thickly slice the carrot into half-moons. Thinly slice the brown onion (see ingredients). Finely chop the garlic.
2. **Roast cauliflower and carrot.** Place the cauliflower and carrot on a lined oven tray. Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with the Mumbai spice blend and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat. Roast until tender and brown around the edges, 20-25 minutes.  
3. **Start the biryani.** While the veggies are roasting, heat a drizzle of olive oil in a deep frying pan or large saucepan over a medium-high heat. Cook the onion, stirring, until soft, 4-5 minutes. Add another drizzle of olive oil, the Bengal curry paste (see ingredients) and garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute.  
4. **Add** the basmati rice and currants, stirring to coat. Add the warm water (1 1/2 cups for 2 people / 3 cups for 4 people) and vegetable stock pot, then bring to the boil. Cover and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook for 10 minutes, then remove pan from the heat. Keep covered until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed, 10 minutes.  *TIP: The rice will finish cooking in its own steam, so don't peek!*  
5. **Finish the biryani.** While the biryani is cooking, roughly chop the coriander and roasted almonds. When the rice is done, stir through the almonds, roasted veggies and 1/2 the coriander. 
6. **Serve up**. Thinly slice the long red chilli (if using). Divide the roast cauliflower biryani between bowls. Top with the Greek-style yoghurt. Sprinkle with the chilli and remaining coriander to serve.
