# Dara's Tomato Soup

## Ingredients

- 5kg tomatoes
- 7 garlic cloves
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 brown onion
- 1 litre (4 cups) vegetable stock/broth
- 1/2 tsp sugar
- _optional_ 1/2 cup cream 
- _optional_ 1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh basil leaves

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C fan-forced.
2. Cut the tomatoes in half and remove stems. Dice the onion. Peel and crush 2 cloves of garlic (leave the others unpeeled).
3. Place the tomatoes and 5 unpeeled garlic cloves on a tray. Drizzle/sprinkle with the oil, paprika, salt and pepper. Toss to coat, squidging the cut face of the tomato in the oil on the tray to thoroughly coat. Arrange tomatoes cut face up.
4. Roast for 40 to 45 minutes or until there is some charring on the tomatoes.
5. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium high heat. Sauté the remaining garlic and onion for 3 minutes or until the onion is translucent.
6. Remove the garlic cloves from the baking tray. Scrape all the tomatoes and juices into the pot. Squeeze garlic flesh into the pot. Add vegetable stock.
7. Blitz with a stick blender until smooth (or do this in a food processor or blender).
8. Bring to a simmer then lower heat to medium and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in the cream if using.
9. Ladle into bowls, drizzle with cream and garnish with basil.
