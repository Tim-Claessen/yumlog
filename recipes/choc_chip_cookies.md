# Choc Chip Cookies

## Ingredients

- 1 cup (227g) salted butter softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup light brown sugar packed
- 2 tsp pure vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- Â½ tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp sea salt
- 2 cups chocolate chips (or chunks, or chopped chocolate)

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven** to 190 degrees C. Line a baking pan with parchment paper and set aside.
2. **Mix** flour, baking soda, salt, baking powder. Set aside.
3. **Cream** together butter and sugars until combined.
4. **Beat** in eggs and vanilla until fluffy.
5. **Mix in** the dry ingredients until combined.
6. **Add** chocolate chips and mix well.
7. **Roll** 2-3 tbs (depending on how large you like your cookies) of dough at a time into balls and place them evenly spaced on your prepared cookie sheets.
8. **Bake** in preheated oven for approximately 8-10 minutes. Take them out when they are just BARELY starting to turn brown.
9. **Let sit** on the baking pan for 2 minutes before removing to cooling rack.

***Note:** Do not over bake. When you remove the cookies from the oven they will still look doughy. THIS is the secret that makes these cookies so absolutely amazing! Please, I beg you, do NOT over bake!*
