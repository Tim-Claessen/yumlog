# Sourdough Bread

## Ingredients
- 110g starter
- 11g salt
- 385g water
- 500g white flour
- 50g whole wheat flour
- 100g roughly chopped kalamatta olives

## Instructions
1. **Feed starter** using white flour in a 1:1:1 ratio. Use it after it has at least doubled in size (typically would rise to at least 200%).
2. **Mix starter and water** first, then mix in dry ingredients (white flour, whole wheat flour, and salt).
3. **Stretch and fold** every 30 minutes for 2 hours - add the chopped olives gradually during this process, making sure they are evenly distributed.
4. **Rest at room temperature** until doubled in size, usually 3-4 hours.
5. **Fold to shape**, place in banneton.
6. Leave in the fridge for as long as desired, typically **8-12 hours**.
7. **Score** the dough.
8. Preheat oven and Dutch oven to **220°C**. Make sure it's close to temp before you start, this is important!
9. **Bake with the lid on** in Dutch oven for **20 minutes at 220°C**.
10. **Bake with the lid off** in Dutch oven for **15 minutes at 180°C**.
11. **Rest on the bench** for a minimum of 1 hour before slicing.
