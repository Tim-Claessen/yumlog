# Pizza Dough

## Ingredients

- 390g “00” flour + some for dusting
- 3/4 tsp instant dry yeast (or active dry yeast)
- 3/4 tsp sea salt
- 275.5ml COLD water
- 1 tbs extra virgin olive oil

## Instructions

1. **Mix** the flour, sea salt, and yeast in a mixer on a low speed until all is incorporated then add the COLD water.
2. Switch to a dough hook and **mix together** on low speed for 8 to 10 minutes. The dough should be smooth and sticky but should not stick to the sides of the bowl, only a little to the bottom. *NOTE - If the dough sticks to the sides sprinkle in a little more flour, if it is too dry then add a bit more water. This will vary every time you make it so keep extra flour handy.*
3. **Place** in lightly oiled tray/bowl, cover with plastic wrap.
4. **Rest** for at least 2 hours (ideally 6-8) in your cold oven (make sure the oven isnt on!!)
5. **Pop the dough** every 1.5-2 hours
