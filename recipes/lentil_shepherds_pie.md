# Lentil Shepherd's Pie

## Ingredients
- 2 cloves garlic
- 50g butter
- 1/3 cup milk
- 400g potatoes (washed)
- 1 carrot
- 2 celery stalks
- 1 brown onion
- 400g sweet potato
- 200g button mushrooms
- 1 cup vegetable stock
- 420g lentils (rinsed)
- 400g diced tomatoes
- 1/2 cup parmesan (finely grated)
- 400g four bean mix (rinsed)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp thyme leaves
- 1 1/2 tbsp fresh rosemary
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 cup frozen peas

## Instructions
1. **Heat oil** in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion, carrot, celery, and garlic, and cook for 7-8 minutes, stirring, or until vegetables soften. Add mushrooms, rosemary, and thyme, and cook for 1 minute, stirring, or until fragrant.
2. **Stir in paste, stock, beans, lentils, and tomatoes**. Bring to the boil, then reduce heat to medium and simmer for 20 minutes, uncovered, or until thickened. Season, remove from heat, and stir in peas.
3. **Meanwhile, bring a large pan of water to the boil**. Cook potatoes for 12-15 minutes or until tender. Drain and return to the pan. Mash, then add butter and milk. Mash again until quite smooth, then season.
4. **Preheat oven to 220°C**. Spoon vegetable mixture into an 8-cup capacity ovenproof dish. Top with mash and sprinkle over parmesan. Bake for 20 minutes or until golden. Serve.
