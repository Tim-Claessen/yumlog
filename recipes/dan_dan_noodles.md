# Dan Dan Noodles

## Ingredients

- 200g Chinese cabbage
• 1 spring onion
• 40g peanut butter 5
• 10g Chinese barbecue seasoning 1,6,17
• 150g vermicelli noodles
• 250g plant-based mince 6
• 10g fried shallots 1
• 2 garlic cloves
• 2 tbs soy sauce 6
• 1 tbs white vinegar
• 2 tsp sugar
• 1 tbs vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. **Boil** a medium saucepan of water to the boil for the noodles. 
2. **Prep the vegetables;** coarsely chop the cabbage. Thinly slice the spring onion, keeping the white and green parts separate. Crush or finely chop 2 garlic cloves.  
3. **Combine** the garlic, peanut butter, Chinese barbecue seasoning, 2 tbs soy sauce, 1 tbs white vinegar, 2 tsp sugar and 11⁄2 tbs water in a bowl and stir until well combined.  
4. **Cook the noodles** and cook for 7 mins or until tender. Drain, then rinse under hot water to prevent the noodles from sticking. Return the noodles to the pan, add 2 tsp vegetable oil and toss to combine.  
5. **Heat** 2 tsp vegetable oil in a medium deep frypan over high heat. Cook the plant-based mince, breaking up the lumps with a spoon, for 3-4 mins until browned. Add the cabbage, sauce and white part of the spring onion and cook, stirring, for 1 min or until the sauce is thickened. Remove the pan from the heat.  
6. **Divide the noodles** and mince mixture among bowls. Scatter over the fried shallots and remaining spring onion. Enjoy!
